This distribution contains several modules.

Number::Phone is a base class for parsing and dealing with phone numbers.

Number::Phone::UK inherits methods from it, over-riding some with UK-
specific implementations.  The intention is that other people will write
other country-specific classes exposing the same API.

Number::Phone::Country is a useful module which will be used by various
Number::Phone::* subclasses in the future, but can also be used on its own.
It was originally written by T. J. Mather but is now maintained by me and
distribute as part of this distribution.

To install these modules, do the usual dance:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Please note that the build-data.* files are not intended for your use.
I use them to re-build the database of UK number allocations.  If you
choose to use them, on your own head be it!
