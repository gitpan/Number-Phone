This package contains two modules.  Number::Phone is a base class for
parsing and dealing with phone numbers.

Number::Phone::UK inherits methods from it, over-riding some with UK-
specific implementations.  The intention is that other people will write
other country-specific classes exposing the same API.

To install these modules, do the usual dance:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Please note that the build-data.* files are not intended for your use.
I use them to re-build the database of UK number allocations.  If you
choose to use them, on your own head be it!
