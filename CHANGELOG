2004-09-15	Number::Phone::UK now implements is_ipphone, and N::P::UK::Data
                has appropriate data in it, as OFCOM have this week published
                the allocations they made a few weeks ago.

                Removed is_voip() alias, it didn't work properly under all the
                possible ways of invoking it.
