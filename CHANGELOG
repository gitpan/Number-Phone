2004-09-22      1.2	Oops, forgot to add is_ipphone to docs for N::P::UK
			last time.

			Updated N::P::UK::Data with some new number ranges.

2004-09-15	1.1	Number::Phone::UK now implements is_ipphone, and
			N::P::UK::Data has appropriate data in it, as
			OFCOM have this week publishedthe allocations they
			made a few weeks ago.

			Removed is_voip() alias, it didn't work properly
			under all the possible ways of invoking it.
