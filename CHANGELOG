2004-12-05	1.3003	new UK number allocations
2004-11-26	1.3002	OFCOM's UK data had some spurious spaces in numeric
                        fields, which broke some 070 numbers, these are now
			filtered out
2004-11-10      1.3001  new UK number allocations
2004-10-20      1.3     Added note about number portability in UK module.
                        Added areaname() method to interface definition
                          and an implementation in the UK module.
			Defined translates_to() method in superclass.
                        Added Number::Phone::Country to distribution.  This
                          was previously maintained by T.J.Mather.
2004-10-13      1.2001  No code changes, just new UK number allocations
2004-09-22      1.2     Oops, forgot to add is_ipphone to docs for N::P::UK
                          last time.
                        Updated N::P::UK::Data with some new number ranges.
2004-09-15      1.1     Number::Phone::UK now implements is_ipphone, and
                          N::P::UK::Data has appropriate data in it, as
                          OFCOM have this week publishedthe allocations they
                          made a few weeks ago.
                        Removed is_voip() alias, it didn't work properly
                          under all the possible ways of invoking it.
